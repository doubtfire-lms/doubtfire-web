# Contributing to Doubtfire Web

We welcome additions and extensions to Doubtfire that help progress our goal of supporting student learning through frequent formative feedback and delayed summative assessment.

## Project structure

Coming...

## Testing

After installing all the dependencies, to run the front-end Angular tests, run the following command:

```shell
npm test
```

### Formatting

- [ESLint] is used in the project to enforce code style and should be
  configured in your [editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).
- [Prettier] is also used and apply automatically by ESLint.

We also use a number of framework plugins:

- [TypeScript ESLint]
- [Angular ESLint]

You can check this manually by running:

```shell
npm run lint
```

You can ask ESLint to fix issues by running:

```shell
npm run lint:fix
```

Please note that not all issues can be fixed by ESLint and Prettier.
