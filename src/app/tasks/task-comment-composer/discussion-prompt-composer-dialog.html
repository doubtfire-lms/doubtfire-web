        Discussions are a great way for both you and your students to gauge student's understanding of concepts and is a
        great learning opportunity for them.
        <br> <br>

        Discussion comments allow you to present up to three discussion prompts to a students on a task. These
        prompts are presented to the student, at which point their spoken reply will be recorded in real time. This
        means you are receiving their unfiltered and immediate response, just like an informal chat in the classroom.
        <br> <br>

        These discussions are designed to be casual and informal and will require a working microphone and speakers.
