      <h5>1. Open CSV</h5>
      <p>
        To mark, open <code>marks.csv</code> in your favourite spreadsheet or text editor.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Open PDF</h5>
      <p>
        Open a student's PDF submission file under the appropriate directory.
        You may choose to annotate or comment on this PDF file.
      </p>
      <h5>3. Decide a new status</h5>
      <p>
        A student may decide that their work is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ready to Mark (or <code>rtm</code>), or</li>
        <li>Needs Help (or <code>needs_help</code>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is indicated in the <code>status</code> column for the respective task
        row in the <code>marks.csv</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you decide what status to update a student's work to, change the
        <code>status</code> column value to one of the following:
      </p>
      <table class="table table-condensed">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>discuss</code> or <code>d</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The student has completed work to a satisfactory
              standard and you will discuss the work with them at
              the next tutorial.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>demonstrate</code> or <code>demo</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The same as <code>discuss</code>, but a reminder for you
              to ask the student to show you the work in class (i.e., prove
              to you that the code works).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>fix</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The student has made some errors and you will want them to
              make fixes to their submission, and resubmit their work for
              re-correction at a later date.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>do_not_resubmit</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The student has consistently submitted the same work without
              making required fixes. This indicates that the student should
              fix the work themselves and include it in their portfolio where
              staff will reassess it.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>redo</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The student has completely misunderstood what the task asked
              of them, or have completed unrelated files to Doubtfire. You want
              them to start the task again from scratch.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>fail</code>
            </td>
            <td>
              The student has failed this task and will no longer have any
              more attempts at uploading further work. Use this sparingly.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h5>4. Leaving a comment</h5>
      <p>
        Your previous comment and the student's previous comment will be
        present in the <code>Student's Last Comment</code> and
        <code>Your Last Comment</code> column, respectively.

        You may choose to add a new comment to this in the <code>New Comment</code>
        column.
      </p>

      <h5>5. Graded task</h5>
      <p>
        If the task is a graded task, you should set the value of the
        <code>New Grade</code> column to one of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>p</code>  - for a task that was completed to a Pass standard</li>
        <li><code>c</code>  - for a task that was completed to a Credit standard</li>
        <li><code>d</code>  - for a task that was completed to a Distinction standard</li>
        <li><code>hd</code> - for a task that was completed to a High Distinction standard</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>6. Rezip</h5>
      <p>
        Re-zip the entire package again, including each student's username folder and
        <code>marks.csv</code>. Alternatively, if you haven't made any annotations to students' work
        you can chose to upload just the marks.csv file instead.
      </p>
