    <p>Preparing your portfolio involves 5 steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select your <strong>Grade</strong> you are applying for</li>
      <li>Upload your <strong>Learning Summary Report</strong></li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Tasks</strong> you want included</li>
      <li>Upload any <strong>Other Resources</strong> you want to add</li>
      <li><strong>Compile</strong> your resources into your portfolio and review</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once you have completed all of these steps, your portfolio will be prepared by {{externalName.value}} and you will be notified when it is ready. You can then check your work, and if you want to make any corrections repeat these steps to create a new version of your portfolio.
