## Getting Started

If you will be using [Docker](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api/#getting-started-via-docker), follow the instructions there.

Before you get started, make sure you have the [Doubtfire API](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api) up and running. You will need to do this before continuing.

First, clone the web repository, and change to the root directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-web.git
$ cd ./doubtfire-web
```

You can automate the installation process by running the automated setup script:

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

Or, you can continue following the below steps to manually install `doubtfire-web`.

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) either by [downloading it](http://nodejs.org/download/) and installing it manually, or via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on OS X:

```
$ brew install node
```

_or_ by using `apt-get` on Linux:

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

Install Ruby [SASS](http://sass-lang.com):

```
$ gem install sass
```

If `gem` fails, you should read the Doubfire API README to install ruby. If you are _not_ using `rbenv`, e.g., using Docker instead, you may need to prepend `sudo` to the above commands to have root write access.

If using `rbenv`, rehash to ensure each of the gems are on your `PATH`:

```
$ rbenv rehash
```

Install all node dependencies using `npm`, as well as [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/using-the-cli) globally:

```
$ npm install
```

**Note:** You may need to install `grunt-cli` globally in Linux using `sudo`.

Lastly, to compile and run a watch server and web server, use `npm start`:

```
$ npm start
```

This will automatically run the angular 1 `grunt watch`, and the angular 7 `ng serve`.

You can then navigate to the Doubtfire web interface at **http://localhost:8000**.

## Deployment

To compile the front-end, ensure `doubtfire-api` is placed as a sibling directory to `doubtfire-web`, then run:

```
$ cd /path/to/repos
$ ls
doubtfire-api    doubtfire-web
$ cd ./doubtfire-api
$ grunt deploy
```

You may prefix this command with the following environment variables:

- `DF_API_URL` - the URL of the API (e.g., `https://doubtfire.com/api`). This will default to `window.location.host` if not set and dynamically generate a URL.
- `DF_EXTERNAL_NAME` - a new name that removes references to the _Doubtfire_ name should you so want to not use such its original name (ðŸ˜¢).

## Resources

Doubtfire Web is an [Angular](http://angularjs.org) application built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). It uses many Open Source libraries, which you can read up on:

- [Lodash](http://lodash.com/docs)
- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
- [UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
- [UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/versioned-docs/0.13.4/)
- [UI Select](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select)
- [NVD3 Charts](http://krispo.github.io/angular-nvd3/#/)
- [Angular X-Editable](http://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/)
- [Angular Filters](https://github.com/a8m/angular-filter)
- [Angular Markdown Filter](https://github.com/vpegado/angular-markdown-filter)
